 * The purpose of this class is to be able to define the basic properties of a Subsystem.
 * As seen below with the abstract class, a Subsystem should be able to do the following:
 * Write to a Log for further Analysis/Error Debugging,
 * Have a Stop Routine after every match,
 * Zeroing all Sensors
 * 
 * <p>The Subsystem should only have one instance and should instantiate all of its member classes.
 * All Subsystems should work as a state machine constantly within two states of
 * the actual state and desired state.
